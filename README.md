# Analysis of Salaries 2023

This project is an analysis of a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data) of salaries in multiple different industries and sectors. Prior to the selection of this dataset, another [dataset](`https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023`) was used. The usage of this older dataset is limited to some visualizations in the plots directory. Otherwise, all work moving forward is done with the first dataset. 

The purpose of this repository is to learn data analysis skills using R.
